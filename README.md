Ever wanted to look at the splash art for a champion, but didn't feel like opening up your client just to do it? How about casually browsing through a specific skin universe? Well, you can do all that and more with Skin Explorer!

## Features

- Synchronized with the PBE patch cycle! (See skins before they hit live servers.)
- Skins grouped by champions, skinlines, and universes.
- Browse through old splash art (all the way back to patch 7.1).
- Add to Home Screen on Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android) to get a more immersive experience!
- Keyboard shortcuts and gestures for fluent navigation.
- Extremely fast load times.
